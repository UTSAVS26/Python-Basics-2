Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.""")

print("""Python Character Set
Python uses the traditional ASCII character set. The latest version (2.7) also recognizes the Unicode character set. The ASCII character set is a subset of the Unicode character set.""")

print("""Identifiers
Python is case sensitive. These are rules for creating an indentifier:
          Must start with a letter or underscore (_)
          Can be followed by any number of letters, digits, or underscores.
          Cannot be a reserved word.""")

A variable in Python denotes a memory location. In that memory location is the address of where the actual value is stored in memory.""")

print("""Operators
1. Arithmetic Operators: These are the arithmetic operators that operate on numbers (integers or floats). The result of applying an arithmetic operator is a number.
          Addition: +
          Subtraction: -
          Multiplication: *
          Division: /
          Remainder: %
          Exponentiation: **

2. Comparison Operators: There are 6 comparison operators. The result of applying the comparison operators is a Boolean - True or False.
          Equal to: ==
          Not equal to: !=
          Greater than: >
          Greater than or equal to: >=
          Less than: <
          Less than or equal to: <=
     You may apply the comparison operator between two operands like so (a > b). You can also apply the comparison operators in sequence like so (a > b > c). However, this is a practice that is not recommended.

3. Boolean Operators: In Python, we have two Boolean literals - True and False. But Python will also regard as False - the number zero (0), an empty string (""), or the reserved word None. All other values are interpreted as True. There are 3 Boolean operators:
          not: unary operator that returns True if the operand is False and vice versa.
          x and y: if x is false, then that value is returned; otherwise y is evaluated and the resulting value is returned.
          x or y: if x is true, then that value is returned; otherwise y is evaluated and the resulting value is returned.""")
